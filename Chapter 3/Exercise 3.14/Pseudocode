Formulate a pseudocode algorithm for each of the following:

a) Obtain three numbers from the keyboard, compute their product and display the result.

    Initialize product to zero
    Input first number
    Input second number
    Input third number
    Set product to first number times second number times third number
    Print the product

b) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display which (if either) is
the smaller of the two numbers.

    Input first number
    Input second number
    If first number is less than second number
        Print the first number
    else
        Print the second number

c) Obtain a series of positive numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display their
average. Assume that the user types the sentinel value -1 to indicate â€œend of data entry

    Initialize total to 0
    Inititalize counter to zero

    Input positive number (possibly the sentinel)
    While user has not yet inputted sentinel
        Add number to total
        Increase counter by 1
        Input the next positive number(possibly the sentinel)

    If counter is not equal to zero
        Set average to the total divided by the counter
        Print the average
    Else
        No number was entered
