QUESTION: Sales tax is collected from buyers and remitted to the government. A retailer
has to file a monthly sales tax report which lists the sales for the month and the amount of sales
tax collected, at both the county and state levels. Develop a program that will input the total collections for a month, calculate the sales tax on the collections, and display the county and state
taxes. Assume that states have a 4% sales tax and counties have a 5% sales tax

    Initialize Total Sales Tax to zero
    Initialize Total Amount Collected to zero

    Input Total Amount Collected(which could be the sentinel)

    While user has not yet entered sentinel
        Input name of month
        Set County Sales Tax to 0.05 times total amount collected
        Set State Sales Tax to 0.04 times total amount collected
        Set Total Sales Tax to County Sales Tax plus State Sales Tax
        Set Sales to Total Amount Collected( Total Collections) minus Total Sales Tax
        
        Print the name of month
        Print  the Total Amount Collected
        Print the Sales
        Print the County Sales Tax
        Print the State Sales Tax
        Print the Total Sales Tax

        Input Total Amount Collected (which could be the sentinel)
