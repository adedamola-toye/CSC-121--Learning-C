A prime number is any natural number greater than 1 that
is divisible only by 1 and by itself. Write a C program that reads an integer and determines whether
it is a prime number or not

    Set counter i to zero
    Set divisibleBy to zero
    
    Input an integer

    While integer is greater than 1 and the counter i is less than the integer
        If integer is divisible by counter i
            Increase divisibleBy by one
            Increase counter i by 1

    If  divisibleBy is equal to zero
        Print the number is a prime number
    Else
        Print the number is not a prime number
