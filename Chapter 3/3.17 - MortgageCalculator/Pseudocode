QUESTION:  Develop a C program to calculate the interest accrued on a bank customer's mortgage. For each customer, the following facts are available:
a) the account number
b) the mortgage amount
c) the mortgage term
d) the interest rate
The program should input each fact, calculate the total interest payable ( = mortgage amount
× interest rate × mortgage term), and add it to the mortgage amount to get the total amount payable.
It should calculate the required monthly payment by dividing the total amount payable by the
number of months in the mortgage term. The program should display the required monthly payment rounded off to the nearest dollar. The program should process each customer's account at a
time.

    Initialize total interest to zero
    Initialize total amount payable to zero

    Input the account number(it could be the sentinel)
    While the user has not yet entered the sentinel
        Input mortgage amount in dollars
        Input mortgage term in years
        Input interest rate as a decimal
    
        Set the total interest to the product of mortgage amount, interest rate, and mortgage term
        Set the total amount payable to the sum of the mortgage amount and the total interest
        
        If mortgage term is not equal to zero
            Set monthly payment to total amount payable divided by the product of mortgage term and 12
            Print the monthly payment
        else
            Print "The mortgage term must not be zero"

        Input account number again
