Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of several
employees. The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and
pays “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You’re given a list of the employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of
each employee. Your program should input this information for each employee and should determine and display the employee's gross pay. 


    Initialize salary to zero

    Input number of hours worked (which could be a sentinel)
    While the user has not yet entered a sentinel
        Input hourly rate as float of 2dp
        
        If number of hours worked <= 40
            Set Salary to be number of hours worked x hourly rate
            Print Salary
        else if number of hours worked > 40
            Set extra hours to be number of hours worked minus 40
            Set Salary to be (40 times hourly rate) + (extra hours times (hourly rate divided by 2))
            Print Salary
