The simple interest on a loan is calculated by the formula
interest = principal * rate * days / 365;
The preceding formula assumes that rate is the annual interest rate, and therefore includes the
division by 365 (days). Develop a program that will input principal, rate and days for several
loans, and will calculate and display the simple interest for each loan, using the preceding formula.
Here is a sample input/output dialog:

    Initialize interest to zero

    Input Principal (which could be the sentinel)
    While the user has not yet entered the sentinel
        Input interest rate
        Input days for the loan
        Set interest to be principal times rate times (days/365)
        Print interest
        Input principal again
